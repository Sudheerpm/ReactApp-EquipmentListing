# Front-end Test Task
## Task

Develop SPA which should manage Equipments. A user can interact with:
 - list of Equipments (better with pagination)
 - adding Equipment (redux-form is allowed but not required)
 - Equipment editing
 - Equipment removing

Front-end part should be developed as SPA with ES6, React and Redux.
You can also use TypeScript to develop this task, but it is not required
Back-end API should be mocked.

```

  	    "serialno": 24,

		"model": "WX7",
		"vendor": "SDIP",

}
```
